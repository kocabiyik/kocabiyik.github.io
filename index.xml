      <description>During my undergraduate Economics program, I took one game theory course. At that time, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t imagine that it would be applied to machine learning. I recently listened to one podcast and watched one talk of Ian Goodfellow (the inventor of GAN) and I was impressed when he explained the GANs in the language of game theory.
What is the &amp;ldquo;Game&amp;rdquo; in the adversarial training? Players: The design of the architecture is like a two-player minimax game: one is a generator, one discriminator.</description>

      <description>I just received the TensorFlow Developer Certificate.
It is a new program (announced in March 2020), and I think I am one of the early-holders of the certificate. Here are my impressions and expectations:
Why Choosing TensorFlow Framework? To have hands-on experience in a deep learning framework, and I have chosen TensorFlow. It is for two reasons:
In general, it is the most popular DL framework. It is mostly used in the industry than in academia.</description>

      <description>Having a strong intuition about algorithms are helpful for hacking and quick prototyping. For me, the most useful tools for grasping good intuition are visualizations and analogies.
The Deep Learning book has a comprehensive chapter on optimizers. I am currently reading it and practicing them by implementing them into code. I am sharing my visualizations here so that it might be helpful for other learners.
