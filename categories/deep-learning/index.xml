      <description>I recently learned one art technique for drawing heads. This technique is called Loomis Method. It is taught by Andrew Loomis in his book, Drawing the Head &amp;amp; Hands.
Anyway, a picture is worth a thousand words. Here is one of my drawings with the Loomis method (Elif):
0. Objective Apart from learning this art technique, I wanted to develop a machine learning model to transform a photo into a Loomis head drawing (and the other way around).</description>

      <description>I just received the TensorFlow Developer Certificate.
It is a new program (announced in March 2020), and I think I am one of the early-holders of the certificate. Here are my impressions and expectations:
Why Choosing TensorFlow Framework? To have hands-on experience in a deep learning framework, and I have chosen TensorFlow. It is for two reasons:
In general, it is the most popular DL framework. It is mostly used in the industry than in academia.</description>
